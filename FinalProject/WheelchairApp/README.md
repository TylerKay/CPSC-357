### Project Description: 
- This project is an attempt/prototype of an iOS app dedicated to supporting wheelchair accessibility users. Currently, it is difficult to find locations that are wheelchair accessible. This app is a prototype of a wheelchair accessible tracker, where the user can place markers and annotate which locations are/aren't wheelchair accessible.
